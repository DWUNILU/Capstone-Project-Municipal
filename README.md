# Capstone-Project-Municipal

## Municipality Information of Canton Lucerne

This project aims to research the contact information of municipal clerks and mayors from the municipalities (Luzern, Emmen, Kriens, Horw, Ebikon) in the Canton of Lucerne. By scraping their respective websites and storing the data in an Excel file.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following parts:

- **Web Scraping**: An R script that scrapes the municipality websites of for relevant information.
- **Data Processing**: The collected data is structured and saved in an Excel file.
- **Documentation**: This README file and potentially additional documentation regarding the use and functionality of the project

## Note on Data Extraction
I was unable to fully automate the data extraction process due to the varying structures of the different municipalities' homepages. Each site uses different HTML structures and selectors, which made it challenging to create a unified scraping script. As a result, I had to implement individual scraping logic for each municipality to correctly extract the required information.

## Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the municipalities of Luzern, Emmen, Kriens, Horw, and Ebikon for providing publicly accessible contact information on their websites :)
